If you have any suggestions, or if something isn't working right, email me at fdedeckerhaylett@gmail.com.

FYI, system errors are logged in the KittingToolErrorLog text file within the KittingTool vX.X.X folder, 
which is most likely on the desktop, so try to send me that file if something goes wrong.

If the KittingToolResources file on the shared drive must be moved for whatever reason, 
remember to update the directories within defaultValues JSON file in the KittingTool vX.X.X folder.

The custom print settings on the source files are landscape 80% scale. Use this if a new source file is made.
