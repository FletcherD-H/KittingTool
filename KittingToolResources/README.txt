If the KittingToolResources file on the shared drive must be moved for whatever reason, 
remember to update the directories within defaultValues JSON file in the KittingTool vX.X.X folder.

When making a new kit, remember to do it with a copy of an existing excel file,
since they have adjustments like preset print settings already made.
